# keychain\_access

The idea behind keychain\_access is to provide Keychain features in the command line.  Apple's [security(1)](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/security.1.html) command does already some of this work. Unfortunately there is no convenient way to to access public/private key pairs stored in the Keychain via security(1).

This is why I wrote keychain\_access.  I wanted to use private keys stored in my keychain in command-line scripts.  This is helpful for signing files for
[Sparkles](http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/) appcast without having to type my password all the time, while at the same time not having to worry that my private key is stored in plaintext on my harddrive.


## Usage

<pre>
$ keychain_access -h
Usage: keychain_access [-vh] [-p &lt;password>] &lt;key_name>
Options:
  -p &lt;password>   Encrypt exported private keys with &lt;password>.
                  The default is to export them without a password.
  -h              Show this information.
  -v              Print current version number.
  &lt;key_name>      The name of the keychain item you want to access.
                  Has to be a public or private key.
</pre>

If you want to pass a key from the Keychain to an openssl command without the key touching the harddrive, use a named pipe.  This is how I use keychain\_access to sign Sparkle updates:

<pre>
PIPE=$OUTPUT_DIR/key.pipe
mkfifo -m 0600 $PIPE
keychain_access a.unique.name.for.the.private.key > $PIPE &amp;

SIG=`openssl dgst -sha1 -binary &lt; "$OUTPUT_DIR/$VOL.dmg" | openssl dgst -dss1 -sign "$PIPE" | openssl enc -base64`

rm $PIPE
</pre>


## Installing
